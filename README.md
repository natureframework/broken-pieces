# Broken Pieces of Bread

This repository contains Bible citations about the standalone teachings, stories, and words of Jesus from the four Gospel books. Jesus is the true bread of life, and we break His words into smaller pieces that are easy to digest. The list can be found in the [citations.txt](citations.txt) file. Admins will slowly add to this list manually.
